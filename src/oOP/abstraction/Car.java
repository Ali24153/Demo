    // but we can declare  and assign value but we can not declare a static variable and all the values are final
    //but we can reassign the variable where implement happen
    // interface is 100% abstract.
    //we can declare another interface inside the interface
    // we can not create  a method with a  body ex: public void display()and no body(no Block) called abstract method
    // we can create return method but it has to be static
    //implement method means getting properties from the interface
