To do the Abstraction we have to do 2 things
 1-Interface: In interface you can not instantiate (call)
 a  variable and create object & you can only use public as modifier &
 to access an interface it must be implement with a class
 an interface is prototype
 interface is guideline for future/
 proto type is a design for your references so that the development team can follow this to develop a complete product

 2- Abstract Class
